                        As you may or may not know, the medical school application process is a rolling admissions
                        process. From getting secondaries to complete, receiving interview applications, and finally
                        gaining an acceptance, all are heavily influenced by the timing of your application. While
                        submitting the primary applicaiton in late July does not necessarily mean you will fail to
                        matriculate, it will put you at a disadvantage compared to your peers. This is why it is
                        heavily advised to submit your primary application withing the first week of June and
                        subsequently submit your secondary applications as soon as possible. That said, timing also
                        includes allocating time regarding letters of reccomendation and working on your personal
                        statement. Remember, professors are constantly being asked to write letters of
                        reccomendation so I advise that you ask between January-February.

                        From maintaining a great GPA, doing research, volunteering (both clinical and
                        non-clincical), shadowing, scoring a high MCAT score, to also being expected have their own
                        interesting and personal lives, it is no doubt that medical schools ask a lot of their
                        applicants. Reflecting upon the rat race of getting into medical, some may lose themselves
                        in trying to seemingly check the metaphorical boxes of research, volunteering, shadowing
                        etc. While I do admit that all are important and play their respective role in measuring the
                        desire one may have when it comes to getting into medical school, I advise that you focus on
                        the quality of your extracurriculars rather than the sheer quantity. This not only shows
                        dedication in your respective interests but it also helps when listing your top formative
                        experiences in the AMCAS primary application. For me, one formative extracurricular was
                        track and field. While not directly related to medicine, track and field taught me immensly
                        in regards to discipline, teamwork and self responsibility. The sport of track and field has
                        undoubtly made me the person I am today and will shape me into the physician I strive to be
                        as well.

                        Unfortunately, some people still think that your major plays a big role in helping you get
                        into medical school. That said, some schools even have a "pre-med/pre-clinical" major. Dont
                        feel obligated to choose these majors simply because you want to be a doctor. If you do not

                        graduating. Schools
                        will not look at you differently if you have a non-science major. In fact, choosing a
                        "non-traditional" major may even make the school more interested in you as a candidate.

                    <p style="display: none">
                        Reflecting upon the application process, one thing I greatly underestimated was how
                        expensive the of it was. For example, if one was to apply to 12 schools (which is four less
                        than the average number schools applied to), they should expect to pay about $1800 on the
                        primary and secondary applications alone. These costs don't even include flights and hotels
                        for interviews which further contributes to the hole you can find yourself in. This is why
                        it is imperative you develop an appropriate school list based on your stats, experiences,
                        interests, etc. One thing that I highly encourage you to look into is the MSAR. This book
                        (while $28) contains data on all US medical schools such as the average GPA and MCAT score
                        of matriculants as well as data on state/out of state matriculants. Please dont be that
                        person that applies to a school only to find out they dont accept out of state applicants.
                        The MSAR will help you know this!

                    <p style="display: none">
                        From my personal experience, the MCAT has by far been the hardest exam that I have taken in
                        my life. Given the scope of content needed to cover as well as the implications the exam
                        has, it is no wonder that some people spend well up to 5 months in advance studying for the
                        exam. In preparing for the MCAT the first thing you should do is figure out your test date
                        and schedule backwards from there, allocating sufficient studying time. Remember, it is a
                        marathon and not a sprint, so don't oversell yourself thinking that you won't burn out
                        trying to do 12 hour sessions over the course of 20 days.

                        <br />
                        In terms of actually studying for the test, I regret to inform you that this is on you. One
                        piece of advice I will give however is to not focus on the content.The only way to improve
                        upon your score is to do actual problems and try and learn how the test is written. Exam
                        prep wise, I find them all the same. While I personally used Kaplan, I have had friends use
                        the Princeton Review, Examkrackers, and the Berkeley Review and still find their own
                        success.

                        Why do YOU want to be a doctor? This is the question that needs to be answered in your
                        personal statement. In spite of what may seem as a straight forward question, people still
                        feel that they need to answer the question with the aim to say what they believe admissions
                        committees want to hear. "I like to help people", "I like science", sprinkled in with the
                        desire to "help the underserved" are oftentimes said. The thing however, is that there are
                        many professions where one can do these same exact things. Writing a personal statement is
                        difficult and takes an immense ammount of introspection upon your life and what you have
                        done that has prepared you for a career in medicine. That said, if your love of dance and
                        cooking helped shaped your desire to be a physician more than that medical mission you went
                        on, be honest about it. Such genuineness will only make your personal statment more genuine,

                        Sometimes, people may feel pressured into applying before they were ready. Admittedly, my
                        parents weren't particularly excited when I told them I planned on taking a gap year so
                        imagine what was going through my head when I was about to tell them I would be taking a
                        second year off. At the end of the day, medical school is not going anywhere. In fact, the
                        average age of matriculants is 24. As expensive and rigorous the process is, one should
                        strive to only have to go through it once. Despite the pressure of family members or seeing
                        pictures of your friends from their white coat ceremonies, one of the biggest pieces of

                            This may be my most controversial piece of advice, but if you even have a glimpse of
                            wanting to specialize in the United States, do not apply to a Caribbean medical school.
                            Admittedly, Caribbean medical schools are easier to get into compared to US medical
                            schools. This however, is oftentimes at the cost of not having the freedom to pursue a
                            specialty of interst as well as being unable to secure a residency at some hospitals. In
                            addition to eing for profit, Caribbean medical schools also have certain rules that are
                            conducive to high rates of student attrition leading to some individuals being kicked
                            out while still having to foot high cost student loans. While having an MD may be seen
                            as sexier than a DO to some, this should not be at the expense of attending a Caribbean
                            medical school. For more information, you can read this blog

                        alone. Heck, the act of asking for a letter of reccomendation or the opportunity to shadow
                        is a request for help in of themselves. That said, if you're one that struggles with asking
                        for help put all your pride aside and learn how to do so. One great place to start is with
