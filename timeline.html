                    <h3>Graduation</h3>
                    <p>In June of 2018, I graduated from college. Aiming to take two gap years before
                        matriculation, the
                        question that faced me was where I wanted to work during my gap years. Choosing to remain in
                        Chicago, it was time to join the adult world and find a job in order to keep a roof over my
                        head. On top of that, my studies were not yet done as I had to face a big hurdle in the medical
                        school admissions process... the MCAT.</p>

                    <h3>Post Grad Job</h3>
                    <p>Deciding to stay in Chicago post graduation meant that I needed a job in order to keep a roof
                        over my head and food on my plate. Coupled with taking time off before medical school, this
                        meant that ideally my job would be related to medicine. Fortunately, I was able to secure a job
                        at the Bucksbaum Institute for Clinical Excellence, a great institution dedicated towards the
                        humanities of medicine.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important exams of my (and your) premed journey is the MCAT. Sadly graduating
                        college did not give me free time to travel, relax etc. as I actually had to study for the MCAT.
                        This was a grueling 8 hour exam that I fortunately only had to take once. Check out my <a

                        to medical school. My alma matter is one of these schools. In order to get a committee letter
                        however, there were some things that I needed to complete such as submitting a draft of my
                        personal statement, multiple short essays, and an interview.</p>

                    <h3>AMCAS Opens</h3>
                    <p>The "Common App" of the medical school applicaiton process, the AMCAS application opens on May 1.
                        This marks the beginning of preparing your applicaiton in terms of your personal statment,
                        activities, grades, and school selection. It is highly reccomended that you start working on
                        your application as soon as AMCAS opens. One key thing about the processs is that it's a rolling
                        proces meaning that the earlier you get your materials in, the better chance of an acceptance.

                        that I was really in the game. Again,it is highly recommended that you submit your amcas
                        applicaiton for a better chances of getting an interview and eventual admittance.</p>

                        influential to my views and desires of a career in medicine, be that the humanitarian aspect. In

                        application from the schools which I applied to. Applying to 26 schools, I completed 25
                        secondaries. One lesson I learned from this cycle is to not get complacent! These secondaries
                        can really be a lot.</p>

                        the schools that applied to. This was finally that time where I could actually relax and now
                        wait for schools to get back to me. That said, my bank account was far from relaxing.</p>

                        to medical school! In all honesty, my application cycle is still going but having received one
                        accpetance, I know that at the end of the day I will be a physician. Just remember, it only
