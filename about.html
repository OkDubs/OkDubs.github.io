                <p> To be honest, I would be lying if I said that I wanted to be a doctor straight from the jump. As
                    many boys who enjoyed sports, I wanted to be a professional athlete. Being a soccer player, I didn't
                    have hoop dreams... I had
                    Premier
                    League aspirations.

                <p> As I grew older and played in more competitive youth soccer leagues, I soon realized that becoming a
                    professional soccer player would be a lot harder than I initially thought it out to be. It would be
                    then when I would see medicine as a "reasonable" backup plan. Raised in a immigrant household (with
                    Nigerians) medicine was a part of the "Professional Holy Trinity" (Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer). That
                    said, and even having a mom whom worked as a physician, I saw past the job security, money, and
                    prestige but was rather drawn to the fulfillment that my mom was experiencing.</p>

                <p>Working towards my goal of becoming a physician, I did all I could to set myself up for a path
                    towards medicine. Staying true to myself however, I also focused on things that enjoyed me and made
                    some incredible friends along the way. Looking back to my days playing soccer, I realize how my
                    participation in athletics both prepared me for medical school and brought into my life a great
                    group of guys who I am still friends with till this day. Running track and field in college, I also
                    established great relationships with individuals from all over the country, while also instilling
                    life skills such as time managment and lessons in personal responsibility.</p>

                <p>Having the support of my friends, mentors, and family in addition to the life lessons and skills
                    athletics had brought me, I perservered through the grueling process that is applying to medical
                    school. From studying hours on end for the MCAT, writing a lengthy primary application and 25
                    secondary applications, traveling for interviews, and experiencing multiple rejections, I am excited
                    to say that I have receieved admittance into medical school and am one step closer to fulfilling my
